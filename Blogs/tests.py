# Create your tests here.



# In addition you should write some basic tests to verify:
# 1. All model fields have the correct label and length.
# 2. All models have the expected object name (e.g. __str__() returns the expected value).
# 3. Models have the expected URL for individual Blog and Comment records (e.g. get_absolute_url() returns the expected URL).
# 4. The BlogListView (all-blog page) is accessible at the expected location (e.g. /blog/blogs)
# 5. The BlogListView (all-blog page) is accessible at the expected named url (e.g. 'blogs')
# 6. The BlogListView (all-blog page) uses the expected template (e.g. the default)
# 7. The BlogListView pagination records by 5 (at least on the first page)
